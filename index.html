    <p>Are you ready, kids?
        Aye, aye, Captain!
        I can't hear you!
        Aye, aye, Captain!
        Oh!
        
        [Chorus: Painty the Pirate, Kids, & Both]
        Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        Absorbent and yellow and porous is he
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        If nautical nonsense be something you wish
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish!
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        [Bridge: Painty the Pirate, Painty the Pirate & Kids]
        Ready?!
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        SpongeBob SquarePants!
        
        [Outro: Painty the Pirate]
        Ah-hah
        Hahaha
        Ah-hah, hahahar
